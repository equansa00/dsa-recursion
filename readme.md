# Recursion Exercises

This repository is dedicated to practicing recursion through a series of exercises that demonstrate different use cases for recursive functions in JavaScript.

## Overview

Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. This project includes a variety of recursive functions that solve problems such as calculating the product of numbers in an array, finding the longest word in an array of words, and more.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and ensure you have Node.js installed to run the JavaScript files.

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-link.git
cd dsa-recursion
```

## Installation

Install the necessary dependencies (if any):

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests

This repository comes with a set of predefined unit tests for each recursive function to ensure correctness:

```bash
npm test
```

## Exercises

The following recursive functions are included:

- Product of Nums: Calculate the product of an array of numbers.
- Longest Word: Determine the length of the longest word in an array of words.
- Every Other Character: Create a string from every other character in a provided string.
- Is Palindrome: Check whether a given string is a palindrome.
- Find Index: Find the index of a given value within an array.
- Reverse String: Reverse a string.
- Gather Strings: Extract all string values from a nested object.
- Binary Search: Perform a binary search on a sorted array.

## Further Study and Challenges

For those looking to further challenge their understanding of recursion, additional exercises and challenges are provided, including:

- Balanced Brackets using recursion.
- Split Square challenge.
- Boggle game solver using recursion.

These exercises are intended to provide a deeper exploration into the power and versatility of recursive programming.
